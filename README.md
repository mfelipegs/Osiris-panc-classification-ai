## Osiris PANCs Classification AI

Osiris is an AI project aimed at classifying Non-Conventional Food Plants (PANC) using deep learning techniques. The project integrates AI into a Kotlin application, allowing users to capture images of plants and receive predictions on whether they belong to specific PANC categories.

### Features

- Classification of Ora-pro-n√≥bis, inhame, hibisco, and other PANCs.
- Integration with a Kotlin application for real-time plant classification.
- Utilizes TensorFlow for deep learning model development and training.
- Provides an easy-to-use interface for capturing images and viewing classification results.

### Dataset

The dataset contains high-quality images of various PANCs, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Images are pre-processed and normalized for use in training the deep learning model.

### Installation and Usage

To use Osiris AI, clone the repository and follow the installation instructions in the README. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies, including TensorFlow and OpenCV, installed in your environment.

### Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Together, we can improve the accuracy and usability of Osiris AI for plant classification.
